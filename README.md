This project is a simple recommendation system that suggests items to users based on their preferences. It utilizes techniques like collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to recommend movies, books, or products to users.


Introduction
This project implements a recommendation system that provides personalized suggestions to users. By leveraging collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, the system can recommend items based on user behavior and item characteristics.

Features
Collaborative Filtering: Recommends items based on the preferences of similar users.
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends items based on the features of items the user has liked in the past.
Hybrid Approach: Combines both collaborative and content-based filtering for improved recommendations.
Evaluation Metrics: Implements metrics to evaluate the performance of the recommendation system.
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Surprise (for collaborative filtering)
Steps
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-recommendation-system.git
cd simple-recommendation-system
Create and activate a virtual environment:
bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare your dataset: Ensure your dataset is in the correct format (user-item interactions for collaborative filtering and item features for content-based filtering).
Train the model: Run the training script to build the recommendation models:
bash
Copy code
python train.py --data_path /path/to/dataset
Generate recommendations: Use the trained model to generate recommendations for users:
bash
Copy code
python recommend.py --user_id USER_ID --model_path /path/to/saved/model
Recommendation Techniques
Collaborative Filtering
Collaborative filtering recommends items to a user based on the preferences of similar users. It can be implemented using techniques such as user-based or item-based filtering.

Content-Based Filtering
Content-based filtering recommends items to a user based on the features of items the user has previously liked. It relies on item metadata and user preferences.

Hybrid Approach
A hybrid approach combines both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to leverage the strengths of both methods and provide more accurate recommendations.

Data Preparation
User-Item Interactions: A dataset containing user IDs, item IDs, and interactions (e.g., ratings, clicks).
Item Features: A dataset containing item IDs and their corresponding features (e.g., genres, descriptions).
